## Install Go

Follow the instructions at https://golang.org/doc/install

## Install VS Code

 - Follow the instructions at https://code.visualstudio.com
 - Open VS Code
 - Select `Open Folder` and navigate to your repository
 - Open a file that ends in `.go`
 - A small window will open in the bottom right offering to install the Go extension. As you start to write code a lot of these will come up... you might as well let it install all the helper packages.
